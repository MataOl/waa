# Test Automatization Course

This is an output from the Test Automatization Course which I have taken. We used Java, Selenium and JUnit.  
Commits dated 3 June 2019 represent my **Final Examination** (duration: 3 hours). The **tasks** in the examination were:  

1. Download page <https://github.com/skarbala/ta-mentor-program-playground> and launch it using MAMP.
2. You will test the page **Savings Calculator**.
3. For testing, use the same project we used throughout the whole course.
4. **Automate** following scenarios, use your own names for the methods:

     a) Enter all data (fond, sum, email, years), the button "Apply for saving" is enabled.
     
     b) Enter all data (fond, sum, email, years), check that the sums are not empty.
     
     c) Enter all data (fond, sum, email, years), check that the risk is not empty.
     
     d) Enter all data (fond, sum, email, years), click the "Apply for saving" button, check that new note is displayed in "recent    requests", check that the new note contains the name of the chosen fund.
